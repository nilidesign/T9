                    The trilogy sounds better than ever too, thanks to an HD update to Crash’s soundtrack, which has always been an infectious earworm of drums and marimba. While not the exact same tracks as the original game, the new score captures the soul and energy so well that I seriously need this soundtrack on its own now. But it’s the little touches that really impressed me this time around. The way the patter of Crash’s footsteps changes from sand to concrete, or Polar’s yelps mixing with the cries of whales bring the wacky, weird, and beautiful levels to life.

                    Having years to reflect on them and returning now to the trilogy in this new form, Cortex Strikes Back endues as the best overall package. There’s an excellent blend of truly challenging core platforming and extra objectives — secret levels, Death Routes, and extra gems all make a return. The second entry offers a smart balance of maddening difficulty but also makes me feel that overcoming every obstacle will take just one more try — even if it really takes a dozen more.
